# PRG1 Pair Programming - Password Statistics

## Overview

This repository contains code to analyse a dataset of the 10,000 most common passwords. You'll be working with CSV file handling, data processing, and statistical analysis.

## Two Coding Approaches

This repository demonstrates two different programming approaches:

### 1. Functional Approach (`stats_functions.py`)
- **Modular Design**: Code is broken into separate, reusable functions
- `delete_existing_output_file()` - Handles file cleanup
- `process_and_print_lines()` - Processes the input data
- **Benefits**: More maintainable, testable, and follows single responsibility principle

### 2. Monolithic Approach (`stats_monolithic.py`)
- **Single Function**: All functionality combined in one `monolithic_data_processor()` function
- **Benefits**: Simpler for small tasks, everything in one place
- **Drawbacks**: Harder to test individual components, less reusable

## Discussion Questions

Before diving into coding, discuss these questions with your partner:

1. **What is the purpose of the `os` library in this code?**
2. **Explain what the `os.path.exists()` and `os.remove()` functions do.**
3. **How does the `process_and_print_lines` function handle the data from the input file?**
4. **Does it read the entire file into memory at once, or does it process the file differently? Explain why this method is useful.**
5. **Why is the code broken into two separate functions (`delete_existing_output_file` and `process_and_print_lines`)?**
6. **What's the benefit of separating these two actions, even though they are both part of the overall program?**

### Task 1: Complete the Basic Functionality
The current program is unfinished - it only prints the passwords but doesn't analyse them.

**Your goal**: Count the length of each password and keep a running total which is displayed at the end.

Count the number of occurrences of password lengths from the 10,000 passwords and store the results in the output file (`statistics.csv`).

**Expected Output Format:**
```
Chars: 0,Count: 0
Chars: 1,Count: 0
Chars: 2,Count: 0
Chars: 3,Count: 3
Chars: 4,Count: 810
Chars: 5,Count: 903
Chars: 6,Count: 3176
Chars: 7,Count: 1771
Chars: 8,Count: 2972
Chars: 9,Count: 219
Chars: 10,Count: 94
...
```

### Task 2: Creative Extensions
What other statistics might you be able to calculate?

Ideas to explore:
- Number of passwords beginning with A? B? C? (A through Z analysis)
- Number of passwords starting with a number (0-9)
- Most common first character overall
- Passwords containing only numbers vs only letters vs mixed
- Average password length
- Passwords containing special characters

Be creative and think of other interesting patterns you could analyse!

## Files in this Repository

- `10000-common-passwords.csv` - Input data file containing the password list
- `stats_functions.py` - Functional approach implementation (starter code)
- `stats_monolithic.py` - Monolithic approach implementation (starter code)
- `statistics.csv` - Output file (will be generated by your code)

## Getting Started

1. Choose which approach you'd like to work with (`stats_functions.py` or `stats_monolithic.py`)
2. Read through the code with your partner
3. Discuss the questions above
4. Start implementing the password length counting functionality
5. Test your code and verify the output matches the expected format
6. Move on to the creative extensions

## Hints

A data structure to store the counts would be helpful. A dictionary would work (with the keys being different password lengths 1-20), or you could use a list:

```python
lengths = [0] * 21  # Creates a list with 21 locations, each initialized to 0
```

This allows you to use `lengths[password_length] += 1` to increment the count for each password length.
