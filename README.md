# PRG1-pair-programming-PWstats

1. Take your time to read and understand the code. Explain lines in turn to your partner.
This program is unfinished. Can you count the length of each of the 10000 passwords and keep a running total which is displayed at the end?

2. Count the number of occurrences of the different lengths of the 10000 passwords and store the results in the outputFile (statistics.csv). Hereâ€™s a sample output that you are aiming for:

    ![Expected output](assets/expected_statistics.png)

   Have a think about it first (seriously!!), but if you want a hint, scroll down to the bottom.

4. What other statistics might you be able to calculate?
    - Number of passwords beginning with A? A through to Z?
    - Number of passwords starting with a number?
    - What else?

### 

A data structure to store the counts in would be good. A dictionary would work (with the keys being different password lengths 1-20), or you could use an array, which is what I did. ```lengths = [0] * 20```. This creates an array with 20 locations, each initialised to 0.
